# LingWizard

LingWizard is a language learning app that uses games to teach Grammar and eventually Vocabulary. There are many apps out there that teach vocab, and some do it very well(Rosetta Stone,Memrise,etc.). However, they barely cover grammar or omit it entirely from their lessons, giving users only half of the picture. LingWizard aims to apply the same gamification strategies that current language learning apps use and apply it to grammatical concepts.

## Present Stage of Development

LingWizard is in its infant stages of development. This means that we are currently building the backend framework for the app. The diagram above outlines the various components and how they interact with each other. The three types of components are: View(blue), Main Model(orange),and Lanugage Package(yellow). There is only one View and one Main Model, but there is a Language Package for each language. The arrows show the flow of information between components.
