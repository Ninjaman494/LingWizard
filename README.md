# LingWizard

LingWizard is a language learning app that uses games to teach Grammar and eventually Vocabulary. There are many apps out there that teach vocab, and some do it very well(Rosetta Stone,Memrise,etc.). However, they barely cover grammar or omit it entirely from their lessons, giving users only half of the picture. LingWizard aims to apply the same gamification strategies that current language learning apps use and apply it to grammatical concepts.

## Present Stage of Development

LingWizard is in its infant stages of development. This means that we are currently building the backend framework for the app. A diagram outline of the framework will eventually be added to the readme outlining how the app will be structured.

## Contributing
Contributions are currently on hold while the framework is being built, this is to make contributions easier for other developers.

[//]: # "Since this app are in the early stages of development, now is a great time for contributors to join in since there is so much work to be done and code that needs to be written. Below is a list ### What we Need"
