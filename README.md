# LingWizard

LingWizard is a language learning app that uses games to teach Grammar and eventually Vocabulary. There are many apps out there that teach vocab, and some do it very well(Rosetta Stone,Memrise,etc.). However, they barely cover grammar or omit it entirely from their lessons, giving users only half of the picture. LingWizard aims to apply the same gamification strategies that current language learning apps use and apply it to grammatical concepts.

## Present Stage of Development 

I have begun building the Android application and have quickly realized that most of the code on master is useless. I originally planned on merging the back-end I created with the front-end, but since this is my first foray into Android development I didn't realize how different Android programs are structured. Even though I'm basically starting from stratch, I have made great progress on the app and have already built out a lot of the framework.

## Contributing
Since this app is in the early stages of development, now is a great time for contributors to join in since there is so much work to be done and code that needs to be written. No matter your skill level, there is definitly something you can help with. Follow the below instructions to begin contributing.

1. Fork the repository to your account and set it up locally.

3. After you pick an issue to work on, PLEASE comment on it so we know someone is working on it. In some cases, someone could already be working on an issue. Also, some issues are really broad, so we might request that you create another, more specific, issue when you respond.
4. Make a new branch titled after the issue your working on, all your commits should be to this branch. 
5. When your ready, submit a pull request outlining what you've done and how your code works. We'll take it from there.
